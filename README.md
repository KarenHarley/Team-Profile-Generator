# Team-Profile-Generator
This is Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 

***Note***

The instuctional staff posted the solution as a mistake but instucted me to add additional functionality to the already completed solution (which I gladly did based on their recommended guidelines).

## Additional Functionality

This additional feature was not required but added nonetheless.

The user will be prompted with additional questions that will be displayed when the user hovers over the employee card. The information displayed is for example the age, sex, current project of the employee.
